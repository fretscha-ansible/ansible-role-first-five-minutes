First Five Minutes
========

Bryan Kennedy's blog post [My First 5 Minutes On A Server; Or, Essential Security for Linux Servers][1] inspired me to write this role for ansible.

The goal of this role is a basic initial setup with minor security tweaks.

Requirements
------------

This role requires Ansible 1.4 or higher.

It has successfully been tested on following Digital Ocean images
* Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin)
* Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal)
* Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail)
* Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander)

Accelarated mode is disabled by default. Enabling the accelerated mode requires the `python-keyczar`package installed.


Role Variables
--------------

Take a look at the roles/first_five_minutes/defaults/main.yml to see in detail how defaults are set.
You shall override all defaults in the host_vars or/and group_vars.

* `ffm_root_password`:
  - Description: root_password hash for console login as root.
  - Default: `$6$flk7B1CUbp$ymzXEZ.TRlPWmJaDLI1Y4T56uzTl1N0.QSTS1pfkCDd6LLY3QzyyKVTU3ayVYV5pQgutIeFwSWQRQzsJzGmzR0`

* `ffm_deploy_user`:
  - Description: deploy user which will be used for ansible to deploy. Has sudo rights without password.
  - Default: `default`

* `ffm_deploy_password`:
  - Description: password hash for login as deploy.
  - Default: `$6$RUwI5ZvxW8U$Iq1e1JpZbOIKjpWKM9FZGVvsZyDCJa.cHVLD3wRcTbLFL6LmA9oBZzz5NXDrNEIPKUu.Jl.CfngwY528mHOay1` equivalent of `test`

* `ffm_postfix_mode`:
  - Description: Type of postfix configuration.
  - Values: `internet | smarthost`
  - Default: `smarthost`

* `ffm_fqdn_hostname`:
  - Description: Hostname,  fully qualified domain name.
  - Default: `server.acme.tld`

* `ffm_fqdn_smtp_relay`:
  - Description: postfix smarthost only needed if `ffm_postfix_mode` equals 'smarthost'.
  - Default: `relay.acme.tld`

* `ffm_logwatch_email`:
  - Description: Email address. Where to send `logwatch` notification.
  - Default: ` monitor@acme.tld`


To create a password hash from your plaintext_password run the following line in linux python console (does not work on osx) :
```python
    python -c "import crypt, getpass, random, string; \
    print crypt.crypt(getpass.getpass(), '\$6\$%s\$' % \"\".join(random.sample(string.letters+string.digits, 8)))"
```
