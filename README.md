First Five Minutes
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fretscha-ansible/ansible-role-first-five-minutes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fretscha-ansible/ansible-role-first-five-minutes)

Bryan Kennedy's blog post [My First 5 Minutes On A Server; Or, Essential Security for Linux Servers][1] inspired me to write this role for ansible.

The goal of this role is a basic initial setup with minor security tweaks.

Requirements
------------

This role requires Ansible 1.6 or higher.

It has successfully been tested on following [Digital Ocean][2] images

* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)

* Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)

* Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet)
  - needs the pre-installation of python -  by default only python 3 is installed on vivid, which is not supported by ansible <= 1.9.1 yet.

Older releases of Ubuntu (12.04 | 12.10 | 13.04 | 13.10) had been partially tested successfully.
